# Lorem Ipsum

A demo project that uses headless Drupal 8 and an AngularJS client to generate truly awesome lorem ipsum copy. 

For dev purposes, set your docroot to use the `server` directory; log in to Drupal at the site root. Then add a symlink to access http://localhost/client stuff: `ln -s ../client server/client`
